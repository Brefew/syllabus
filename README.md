Syllabus for the Spring 2015 Data Engineering class at CU Boulder by Prof. Ken Anderson

## Introduction

This course will investigate the software engineering issues involved with creating data-intensive software systems.
We will look at how to support the entire data life cycle including collection, storage, analysis, reporting, and
visualization and what tools and techniques are available for each of these stages. Students will help to create
some of the content for this class by _spiking_ on various technologies (either individually or in teams) and
reporting back what they learned to the class as a whole. Students will work in teams to develop a prototype system
that can support the entire data life cycle.

## Expectations

Students need to be willing to learn new frameworks quickly and be willing to apply what they have learned to
practical problems of data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. I'm assuming that students have software
engineering skills and are comfortable writing code in multiple programming languages. I expect that we'll be
reading/writing code in at least Java, Ruby, Python, and Javascript as we look at a variety of tools and
frameworks in the "big data" space.
