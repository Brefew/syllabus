# Syllabus &mdash; Data Engineering &mdash; S15

Syllabus for the Spring 2015 Data Engineering class at CU Boulder
by Prof. Ken Anderson

## Introduction

This course will investigate the software engineering issues
involved with creating data-intensive software systems.
We will look at how to support the entire data life cycle including
collection, storage, analysis, reporting, and visualization and
what tools and techniques are available for each of these stages.
Students will help to create some of the content for this class by
_spiking_ on various technologies (either individually or in teams)
and reporting back what they learned to the class as a whole. Students
will work in teams to develop a prototype system that can support
the entire data life cycle.

## Expectations

Students need to be willing to learn new frameworks quickly and be
willing to apply what they have learned to practical problems of data
cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. I'm assuming that students have
software engineering skills and are comfortable writing code in
multiple programming languages. I expect that we'll be reading/writing
code in at least Java, Ruby, Python, and Javascript as we look at a
variety of tools and frameworks in the "big data" space.

## Requirements

- Students should have a laptop with them for every class. Most class
sessions will involve hands-on coding or editing of source code, Markdown
files, wikis, etc.

  - If you don't have a laptop then you'll need to find someone to work
    with during the class period.

- A version of the ruby programming language should be installed on your
laptop. Any version of ruby 2.x.x should work fine. (For instance, Prof.
Anderson has 2.1.2 on his machine; 2.2.0 is the latest version of Ruby as
of January 2015.)

- A version of node should also be installed on your machine. If you have
a Mac, the easiest way to install node is via [Homebrew](brew.sh). Simply
install Homebrew and then enter the command `brew install node`. The
latest verion of node as of January 2015 is 0.10.35.

- A version of curl should be installed on your machine. curl is a very useful
utility for interacting with web services. If you have a Mac, curl should already
be installed in `/usr/bin`. For other platforms, head over to
(the curl website)[http://curl.haxx.se/download.html] to download and install
the software.

- Finally, you should be comfortable invoking the developer tools for
your favorite web browser. Within Chrome, simply open a window and then
invoke `View->Developer->Developer Tools`.

- All of these instructions will be reviewed during the first day of
lecture.

## Learning Git

We will be using the Git version control system heavily this semester. I will be covering Git in class but there are plenty of excellent resources on the web to learn more. In particular, the company that creates the application [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com), has an excellent set of resources for learning Git.

- [Learn Version Control with Git](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/)
- [Video Tutorials](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/videos)

## Learning GitHub

We will also be making heavy use of GitHub and so I'll be covering it as well in class. As with Git, there are many resources available on-line to get up to speed with GitHub's features. Here are some pointers to get started:

- [GitHub's Documentation](https://help.github.com)
- [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/)
